- **Present Perfect to Past Perfect**
  - "I have gone to school every day." → "He said (that) he had gone to school every day."

- **Present Progressive to Past Progressive**
  - "I am going to school every day." → "He said (that) he was going to school every day."

  - "I was going to school every day." → "He said (that) he had been going to school every day."

- **Future (will) to Conditional (would)**
  - "I will go to school every day." → "He said (that) he would go to school every day."

- **Imperatives to Infinitive**
  - "Go to school every day." → "He said to go to school every day."

## Question and Modal Changes

- **Yes/No Questions use 'if' or 'whether'**
  - "Do you go to school every day?" → "He asked if I went to school every day."

- **WH-Questions use the WH-word**
  - "Where do you go to school?" → "He asked where I went to school."

  - "I can go to school." → "He said (that) he could go to school."
  - "I may go to school." → "He said (that) he might go to school."

  - "He says, 'I go to school.'" → "He says (that) he goes to school."

- The modals 'might', 'ought to', and 'have to' typically do not change.

## Other Reporting Verbs

- Besides 'said', verbs like 'ask', 'report', 'tell', 'announce', 'suggest', and 'inquire' can introduce indirect speech. Use them appropriately as they are not interchangeable.

# Understanding Passive Voice in English

## The Basics:

- **Active Voice**: The subject performs the action.
  - *Example*: "I drank two cups of coffee."
- **Passive Voice**: The action is performed upon the subject.
  - *Example*: "Two cups of coffee were drunk."

## Creating Passive Voice:

1. Use the correct tense of the verb "to be."
2. Add the past participle of the main verb.
3. For regular verbs, add 'ed' to the infinitive. Irregular verbs vary.

## Tense Examples:

| Tense                  | Active                    | Passive                         |
|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Present Simple         | I make a cake.            | A cake is made (by me).         |
| Present Continuous     | I am making a cake.       | A cake is being made (by me).   |
| Past Simple            | I made a cake.            | A cake was made (by me).        |
| Past Continuous        | I was making a cake.      | A cake was being made (by me).  |
| Present Perfect        | I have made a cake.       | A cake has been made (by me).   |
| Pres. Perf. Continuous | I have been making a cake.| A cake has been being made (by me). |
| Past Perfect           | I had made a cake.        | A cake had been made (by me).   |
| Future Simple          | I will make a cake.       | A cake will be made (by me).    |
| Future Perfect         | I will have made a cake.  | A cake will have been made (by me). |

## Verbs with Two Objects:

- **Active**: "He gave me the book."
- **Passive**: "I was given the book (by him)." / "The book was given to me (by him)."

## Passive in Subordinate Clauses:

- **Active**: "I thought that Mary had kissed John."
- **Passive**: "I thought that John had been kissed by Mary."

## When to Use Passive:

1. To change the focus of the sentence.
2. When the doer is unknown, unimportant, obvious, or general.
3. In factual or scientific writing.
4. In formal writing to avoid using "someone."
5. To place new information at the end for style.
6. When the subject is very long for natural construction.

- Try converting active sentences to passive.
- Write sentences focusing on the action rather than the doer.
